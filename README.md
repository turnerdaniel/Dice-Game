# Dice Game

A 2-player console application for a "Three or More" dice game. Players take turns rolling multiple dice. Matching multiple dice values will increase the player's score until the desired score limit is reached. 

## Getting Started
This program was developed using Visual Studio Community 2015. It is recommend to install the latest version of Visual Studio Community from  the [Visual Studio website](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) in order to view this project. 

Once installed, clone the repository to your computer. Now, open the Visual Studio solution file (.sln) to view the application code. From here, the program can be ran in either debug or release mode using the menus at the top. 

Alternatively, the executable file (.exe) can be run to play the game without any setup. 

## Game Rules

Players take turns rolling all five dice and scoring for three-of-a-kind or better. If a player only has two-of-a-kind, they may re-throw the remaining dice in an attempt to improve the matching dice values. If no matching numbers are rolled, a player scores 0.

**Scoring:**

 - 3-of-a-kind: 3 points 
 - 4-of-a-kind: 6 points 
 - 5-of-a-kind: 12 points

Set the total score for the game and the player that reaches the score limit first is the winner.
